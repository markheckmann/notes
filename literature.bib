	abstract = {In component analysis solutions, post-multiplying a component score matrix by a nonsingular matrix can be compensated by applying its inverse to the corresponding loading matrix. To eliminate this indeterminacy on nonsingular transformation, we propose Joint Procrustes Analysis ({JPA}) in which component score and loading matrices are simultaneously transformed so that the former matrix matches a target score matrix and the latter matches a target loading matrix. The loss function of {JPA} is a function of the nonsingular transformation matrix and its inverse, and is difficult to minimize straightforwardly. To deal with this difficulty, we reparameterize those matrices by their singular value decomposition, which reduces the minimization to alternately solving quartic equations and performing the existing multivariate procedures. This algorithm is assessed in a simulation study. We further extend {JPA} for cases where targets are linear functions of unknown parameters. We also discuss how the application of {JPA} can be extended in different fields.},

The transformation is made so that multiple score and loading matrices are optimally matched to two unknown target matrices, respectively, without affecting the fit of the score and loading matrices to data sets, and without any constraint imposed on the transformation, except for its being nonsingular. The resulting transformed score and loading matrices can reasonably be compared across data sets. A simulation study is performed for assessing an alternate least-squares algorithm for {GJPA}. Additional procedures for interpreting {GJPA} solutions are also presented and they are illustrated with a real data example. Finally, {GJPA} is reconsidered in the contexts of three-way data analysis and canonical correlation analysis.},

In particular, mealiness was associated with the texture of Cox apples. Curved box-plots, an innovative extension of ordinary box-plots, was used to explore the consumers'use of descriptive attributes. This indicated that although consumers perceived mealiness similarly, they described their perceptions differently.},

These methods were found to be suitable for use with child assessors aged 8 years and above. Results showed that the children sorted these vegetables according to sensory properties (especially texture and flavour), situational usages and perceived need for cooking. Textural properties were particularly associated with aversions to certain vegetable preparations.},

In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

The authors argue that people's subjective experiences with and relationships to substances depend largely on personally and socially constructed meanings. Substance use is viewed as part of people's efforts to anticipate the future and construct viable solutions to constructive challenges or problems of meaning. Constructive processes are largely tacit, but substance users are considered agents making choices, who ''know more than they can tell" despite reports of lack of control or understanding. An evolutionary constructivist perspective suggests that substance-centered selves (i.e., ''addictions") evolve in the course of a person's active efforts to construct meaning and adapt to construed social contexts. Selected implications for theory, research, and practice are described.},

Guilford's G index and Holley's H index are special cases of rc, which with r and Tucker's phi are special cases of rg, a general index of correlation via proportionality of paired deviations from constants.

To overcome this limitation a procedure that applies the Generalised Procrustes methods, by way of a progressive sequence inspired to the “forward search”, was developed. Starting from an initial centroid, defined by the partial point configuration satisfying the {LMS} principle, this is extended by joining, at every step, a restricted subset of the remaining points. At every insertion, the updated centroid, redetermined by the new considered points, is compared with the previous by way of the common elements. If significant variations of the similarity transformation parameters occur, they reveal the presence of outliers or non stationary points among the new elements just inserted.},

Dabei wird die Milieuforschung verstanden als ein neues Paradigma der Sozialstrukturforschung und gleichzeitig als ein Bereich, in dem die Integration qualitativer und quantitativer Methoden beispielhaft erfolgt. Im Zentrum stehen die prominenten Milieumodelle von Gerhard {SCHULZE} und Sinus Sociovision. Differenziert wird zwischen dem Milieumodell, das die Einteilung der Gesellschaft in Lebensstilgemeinschaften darstellt ("Milieu-Landkarte") und dem Milieuinstrument, das das zugehörige Instrumentarium quantitativer und qualitativer Methoden ist, um die Milieueinteilung zu (re)produzieren und einzelne Produkte in der Marktforschung quantitativ und interpretativ auf die Milieus zu beziehen. Zwei Problematiken werden vorrangig behandelt: 1. Durch die theoretische und methodische Komplexität der Milieuforschung ergibt sich ein Akzeptanz- und Vermittlungsproblem in der Praxis der Marktforschung. Theorievermittlung im Beratungsprozess und die Einbindung des Kunden in die Interpretationsarbeit wird zum Erfolgskriterium der Marktforschung. 2. Die Feldlogik (hier ist der Bezug {BOURDIEUs} Feldkonzept) der kommerziellen Milieuforschung führt zu einer Strategie von Marktforschungsunternehmen, das eigene Milieumodell zum Standard machen zu wollen und gleichzeitig das technische Wissen um das Milieuinstrument und dessen kommerzielle Verwertung zu monopolisieren. Letzteres führt für die wissenschaftliche Sozialstrukturforschung zu einer Infragestelllung der Validität und damit zu einem Rezeptionshindernis avancierter kommerzieller Milieuforschung.

This chapter introduces the kinds of sensory data to which generalized procrustes analysis ({GPA}) can be applied, along with the rationale for using the method. The theory of {GPA} is provided with special attention for the procrustes analysis of variance. Finally, two applications of {GPA} to sensory profiling data, one conventional and one free-choice, are shown. The chapter presents the results of a {GPA} and the results of {GPA} are displayed in a two-dimensional plot. The analysis of variance is an important tool in interpreting the results, as is the {PCA} that enables inspection of a low-dimensional projection of the group average. When analyzing sensory-instrumental data, often only two data matrices are involved of which one may contain the results of some previous analysis like {PCA} or even another {GPA}. Such a datamatrix with the {PCA} or {GPA} result does not have variables as columns but dimensions. This variant of {GPA} combines the procrustes transformations with a projection onto a low-dimensional space.},

Repertory grids (repgrids) were given on 2 occasions to 16 frequently interacting female university freshmen. On the 1st occasion, Ss were newly acquainted; at the 2nd test, nearly 6 mo. later, friendship groups were identified by sociometric tests. Pairs of friends were found to have more similar personal constructs than nominal pairs of group members, not only on the 2nd repgrid but also on the 1st repgrid, before these friendships had occasion to form. It is hypothesized that after the initial stages of acquaintance, the relationship between an individual's personal constructs and his friendships is 1 of mutual influence. (32 ref.)

The method focuses on the individuality of each person’s attempt at making sense of her/his caring world. Previous papers have focused on a discussion of the repertory grid technique as a research method and tool for psychiatric nurses, an overview of studies using this technique with nurses and social workers, and applications of personal construct theory (from which the technique is derived) to nursing research. A paper by Rawlinson described content analysis of the role constructs elicited from the nurses. In this study, content analysis of caring constructs elicited by nurses and residents was also undertaken, and the results are presented. Additionally, principal component analysis of the repertory grids was carried out, and three examples are presented. This combined analysis provides an in-depth insight into nurses’ perceptions of caring for others; perceptions which guide their caring behaviours. This information can be used by individual nurses to review their caring practice.},

The main intent was to describe the evaluative component of the first factor ({ECFF}) and track changes in it across the 3 times 2 design. Hypotheses concerning the {ECFF} were that (a) the {ECFF} would increase under grid conditions involving figure comparison and a prerating construct valencing procedure and (b) the {ECFF} would increase across administration times. A secondary set of hypotheses related to the first factor as a measure of construct differentiation was as follows: (a) Differentiation would decrease under grid conditions involving figure comparison and a prerating construct valencing procedure, and (b) differentiation would decrease across administration times. A strong positive correlation among the three measures of differentiation was also hypothesized. Results supported hypothesized increases in the {ECFF} for different grid conditions, but, contrary to expectations, the {ECFF} remained stable across administration times. Differentiation scores, however, were found to increase both across grid conditions and administration times.},

	abstract = {The Multi-Center Dilemma Project is a collaborative research endeavour aimed at determining the role of dilemmas--a kind of cognitive conflict, detected by using an adaptation of Kelly's Repertory Grid Technique--in a variety of clinical conditions. Implicative dilemmas appear in one third of the non-clinical group (n = 321) and in about half of the clinical group (n = 286), the latter having a proportion of dilemmas that doubles that of the non-clinical sample. Within the clinical group, we studied 87 subjects, after completing a psychotherapy process, and found that therapy helps to dissolve those dilemmas. We also studied, independently, a group of subjects diagnosed with social phobia (n = 13) and a group diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (n = 13) in comparison to non-clinical groups. In both health related problems, dilemmas seem to be quite relevant. Altogether, these studies, though preliminary (and with a small group size in some cases), yield a promising perspective to the unexplored area of the role of cognitive conflicts as an issue to consider when trying to understand some clinical conditions, as well as a focus to be dealt with in psychotherapy when dilemmas are identified.},

However, most of the literature on crispness and crunchiness focuses on dry foods, and little work has been carried out on wet foods such as fruits and vegetables. The study presented here was designed to address two main issues: firstly, to gain a better understanding of consumer terminology relevant to the textural characteristics of fruits and vegetables, with particular emphasis on crispy and crunchy terms; secondly, to investigate the relationship between the vocabularies used by trained panels and consumers. Products were selected to give a wide range of textural characteristics. Free choice profiling was carried out with a small number of naı̈ve consumers, as well as with trained panellists. Both sets of data were analysed using generalised Procrustes analysis ({GPA}), which allowed comparison of the two sets of vocabularies generated. {GPA} maps showed that sensory perceptions expressed by a trained panel correlated well with consumer terminology. The study also reinforced the idea that crispness and crunchiness are complex concepts that combine a wide range of perceptions such as fracture characteristics, sound, density and geometry. Results showed a better agreement on the meaning and use of crunchy terms by consumers and panellists alike. On the other hand, crispness was less well understood, showing a much wider conceptual space.},

The application of repertory grid techniques (n = 26) in conjunction with generalized Procrustes analysis identified important psychological constructs which determine attitude. A larger survey study (n = 227) examined the reliability and predictive capacity of these items in quantifying attitudes to technology. Factor analysis identified two sub-scales, which appeared to assess perceptions of technological risk and benefit. Internal reliability of the two sub-scales was high, and had pleasing face validity and predictive capacity. An inverse relationship between perceived risk and benefit was found, consistent with previous research in risk perception. Discussion is made of reducing inappropriately high risk perceptions through effective communication of benefits, and vice versa, with the caveat that such an effect is only likely to be observed for technologies where public opinion is uncrystallized and knowledge is low.},

Respondents were asked to react to fifteen applications phrased in general terms, and results compared with a second study where fifteen more specific applications were used as stimuli. Both sets of data were submitted to generalized Procrustes analysis. Applications associated with animals or human genetic material were described as causing ethical concern, being unnatural, harmful, and dangerous. Those involving plants or microorganisms were described as beneficial, progressive, and necessary. The results were validated in survey research, which indicated that general applications ofgenetic engineering were perceived as either positive or negative, whereas specific applications were more highly differentiated in perceptual terms. The results imply that the public debate about genetic engineering must take due account of the complexity of public concerns.},

Ordination using generalized Procrustes analysis provides a common base for comparing assessors, but the derived configurations are often high-dimensional and difficult to summarize. This problem can be rectified by selecting a small subset of the original set of variables. Methods of variable selection in principal component analysis can be adapted easily for such purposes, but there is no guarantee with these methods that overall data structure is preserved. A recently introduced variable selection procedure that does aim to preserve the data structure as much as possible would seem to be more appropriate. All methods are described and applied to a set of data arising from an attitudinal investigation of meat products. The results indicate that variable selection should be more widely encouraged.},

	abstract = {The repertory grid method ({RGM}) was initially devised to determine how individuals construe their worlds. There have been many attempts to extend this principle to look at relationships amongst objects, as seen by groups of individuals. However, to derive the implied consensus representation of the objects, poses conceptual and mathematical problems because of the idiosyncratic nature of constructs elicited using {RGM}. Generalized Procrustes analysis ({GPA}) offers a solution since there is no assumption of common interpretation of constructs. It is an implicit but apparently untested assumption of {GPA}, that mathematical and perceptual structure are analogous. To test this, combined {RGM}/{GPA} was applied to color. Using the method of triads, 24 subjects independently described constructs to characterize 26 Munsell color chips differing in Hue, Value and Chroma. Subjects then rated the colors on their own construct scales. The first six dimensions of the consequent color space were interpreted as brightness, greenness, lightness, purple/blueness, redness and yellowness. This differs from expectation only in that the colors were recovered on uni-polar dimensions rather than red-green and blue-yellow continua. However, since the main perceptual attributes of color were recovered the analogy assumption of {GPA} is supported, as is application to repertory grids.},

The constructionist emphasis on microsocial processes also functions oppositionally to psychological accounting. The existing animus grows, however, from a realist metaphysics and a correspondence view of language, neither of which constructionism endorses. Viewing the relationship between constructionism and psychological science in more pragmatic terms, we find three significant ways in which constructionism contributes to a more fully enriched and broadly effective psychology. First, critical constructionism functions to denaturalize psychological accounts, opening them to reflexive deliberation, and democratizing the field more generally. Second, constructionist metatheory invites a resuscitation of marginal or suppressed discourse within the field, and invigorates societally engaged efforts to forge new and more useful discourses of the mind. Finally, social constructionism offers the possibility for a fundamental reconceptualization of the self. Illustrative is the family of theories conceptualizing the self as either constituted by or constituting relationships.},

Much of the knowledge generated in {NPD} is tacit; it is difficult to express, connected with problem solving, and dependent on the interactions within teams. Post-project reviews ({PPRs}) are recognized as a highly effective mechanism for stimulating learning in {NPD} teams but, surprisingly, neither the typical “lessons learnt” that emerge from {PPRs} nor the role of tacit knowledge in {NPD} learning have previously been studied. To address this gap, five in-depth case studies were conducted at leading German companies. Three main sources of data were used: interviews with experienced {NPD} personnel using repertory grid technique, inspection of company process and project documentation, and observations of {PPR} discussions. Systematic coding of the qualitative data was conducted by two researchers working in parallel and verified through checks involving independent researchers. The coding process identified the lessons learnt and also the usage of metaphors and stories (which signifies tacit knowledge generation).},

from samples of three varieties of apples (Cox, Jonagold and Boskoop) from three different harvest dates each (early, middle,
and late harvest). The aims of this work were to study whether consumers perceived different degrees of mealiness and to compare
the perceptual spaces of samples obtained from consumer data and from conventional profiling with a trained panel, using Generalized
Procrustes analysis. The relative positions of samples were similar for the consumers and the trained assessors' consensus
spaces but the latter resulted in a better separation of samples. Boskoop samples were perceived as more acid, astringent,
crispy and hard while the Cox variety was described as sweeter and more floury. Jonagold samples were perceived as juicier
and occupied an intermediate position, with the mealy Jonagold sample closer to the Cox samples. The agreement between sample
spaces showed that both panels perceived the major differences between samples in a similar way but the trained panel was
able to differentiate further, mainly between the texture characteristics.},

Verboon (1994) and Verboon and Heiser (1992) showed how iterative weighted least-squares can be used to solve the problem. Kiers (1997) improved upon their algorithm by using iterative majorization. In this paper, we propose a new method called “weighted majorization” that improves on the method by Kiers (1997). A simulation study shows that compared to the method by Kiers (1997), the solutions obtained by weighted majorization are in almost all cases of better quality and are obtained significantly faster.},

This is important as it may have an impact on how we design successful technology-enhanced learning experiences. A Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game ({MMORPG}), World of Warcraft was investigated. Data were collected from a large-scale online survey (1051 responses) as well as in-depth interviews. Findings revealed a range of collaborative and competitive relationships developed during gameplay. What motivates ongoing long-term participation was found to be social praxis along with significant others i.e., online and real-life friends as well as family members.

	doi = {10.1177/0146167205275613},
	abstract = {Theoretically, low correlations between implicit and explicit measures can be due to (a) motivational biases in explicit self reports, (b) lack of introspective access to implicitly assessed representations, (c) factors influencing the retrieval of information from memory, (d) method-related characteristics of the two measures, or (e) complete independence of the underlying constructs. The present study addressed these questions from a meta-analytic perspective, investigating the correlation between the Implicit Association Test ({IAT}) and explicit self-report measures. Based on a sample of 126 studies, the mean effect size was .24, with approximately half of the variability across correlations attributable to moderator variables. Correlations systematically increased as a function of (a) increasing spontaneity of self-reports and (b) increasing conceptual correspondence between measures. These results suggest that implicit and explicit measures are generally related but that higher order inferences and lack of conceptual correspondence can reduce the influence of automatic associations on explicit self-reports.

The implication grid proved superior to the repertory grid under conditions designed to compare stability of matching scores and under conditions designed to compare sensitivity to subjects' changes in construing. The significance of a further result, that the implication grid was superior for reflecting construct bipolarity, is considered in the light of conceptual problems with an assumption of bipolarity. The set of results is especially noteworthy since ‘indirect’ measures were formerly the exclusive province of the repertory grid. The discussion raises general issues about the relative utility of two grid formats, and the unique measurement possibilities of the implication grid are illustrated. It is concluded that the’ implication grid deserves careful consideration for use in studies concerned only with construct relationships.},

The aim of this study was to identify attributes and associations that people use to describe different types of wood materials and to explore how they relate to preferences. The study involved nine samples that were evaluated with the Kelly's repertory grid technique and content analysis. Based on respondents' answers, 19 core categories reflecting sample attributes were extracted. General preferences for each sample were also recorded. Principal component analysis generated two factors describing 1) naturalness, wood-likeness, softness, unprocessed origin, living, pleasant, and high value; and 2) solid and homogeneous impression. A third, preliminary factor included categories describing irregular pattern, sleekness, and smoothness. The wood samples were most liked, whereas composites and panels were not appreciated. Preferred core categories were naturalness, wood-likeness, smoothness, living impression, and value. The least liked core categories were processed, hard, and high weight. The implications of the results for product development and marketing are discussed.},

An overview is given of a number of ready-made building blocks (derived in earlier publications) from which concrete algorithms are set-up with little effort. These algorithms are based on alternating least squares (block relaxation) and iterative majorization. It is demonstrated how the construction of an algorithm for a particular problem that falls in one of the classes of optimization problems under study, reduces to a simple combination of tools. Also, a procedure is reviewed for setting up a weighted least squares algorithm for any problem for which an unweighted least squares solution is available. All procedures are illustrated by means of examples.},

	abstract = {Although there has been some attention in the literature to such issues as students' attitudes toward statistics, instructors are still constantly faced with the challenge to engage students; understand their perceptions, motivations, and interests; and deal with their reluctance and negative attitudes toward the field of statistics. The purpose of the present study was to (1) examine students' attitudes toward statistics; (2) identify characteristics of students with the most negative attitudes toward statistics; (3) determine methods of statistics instruction that students most prefer; and (4) present strategies to overcome fears, resistance, anxiety, and negative attitudes and enhance the learning environment. The findings from the study of 195 graduate social work students demonstrate that factors contributing to statistics anxiety include math phobia, lack of relevance to social work, instructor's characteristics, and classroom environment. Among the preferred instructional methods students identified helpful strategies such as instructors' being attentive to students' anxiety, setting a slow course pace, and providing additional tutoring. The study findings suggested three major areas for enhancing statistics learning: (1) fostering environment that is nonthreatening, friendly, and conducive to learning; (2) clarifying statistical concepts in plain terms; and (3) offering practical skills relevant to students' field of specialization.},

Computer graphics have stimulated interest in the perceptual pros and cons of different formats for displaying data. One way of evaluating the effectiveness of a display is to measure the efficiency (as defined by signal-detection theory) with which an observer extracts information from the graph. We measured observers’ efficiencies in detecting differences in the means or variances of pairs of data sets sampled from Gaussian distributions. Sample size ranged from 1 to 20 for viewing times of 0.3 or 1 sec. The samples were displayed in three formats: numerical tables, scatterplots, and luminance-coded displays. Efficiency was highest for the scatterplots (≅60\% for both means and variances) and was only weakly dependent on sample size and exposure time. The pattern of results suggests parallel perceptual computation in which a constant proportion of the available information is used. Efficiency was lowest for the numerical tables and depended more strongly on sample size and viewing time. The results suggest serial processing in which a fixed amount of the available information is processed in a given time.},

The legitimacy of these assumptions was examined experimentally with the co-operation of ten male medical students acting as subjects. Considerable overlap in element choices based on opposite poles of five construct dimensions appeared for each subject, and the practical effects of this overlap on various types of grid scores were demonstrated.

The results indicate that direct ratings of figures and comparable grid scores are not equivalent, and reveal various kinds of discrepancy from expectations concerning: (a) relations between one whole-figure construct (like self) and personal constructs elicited to define ‘like’ and ‘unlike self’ characteristics; (b) relations between supplied constructs matching highly with like self and elicited constructs defining self and non-self; (c) relations among and between elicited ‘like’ and ‘unlike self’ constructs.

This study explores the motivational factors and dimensions underlying tourists’ food consumption through a combined repertory grid method ({RGM}) and generalised Procrustes analysis ({GPA}) approach. By employing the {RGM} triadic elicitation technique, a total of 14 motivational factors was yielded (i.e., authentic experience, prestige, cultural knowledge, health concern, assurance, convenience, price and value, novelty, variety, familiarity, eating habit, sensory pleasure, social pleasure, and contextual pleasure). Content analysis and {GPA} results further categorised the factors into five dimensions (i.e., symbolic, obligatory, contrast, extension, and pleasure). Based on the findings, a conceptual framework was developed to illustrate how tourist food consumption can be differentiated into supporting consumer experience, peak touristic experience (contrast), peak touristic experience (symbolic) and “attractionised” experience.},

The construct random collection of sentences-story is identified as the key construct in the shaping of selfdefining narrative. Propositions which order motivational processes and memory processes readily follow from aligning personal construct psychology and narrative psychology.

Three experiments are reported showing that presenting brain images with articles summarizing cognitive neuroscience research resulted in higher ratings of scientific reasoning for arguments made in those articles, as compared to articles accompanied by bar graphs, a topographical map of brain activation, or no image. These data lend support to the notion that part of the fascination, and the credibility, of brain imaging research lies in the persuasive power of the actual brain images themselves. We argue that brain images are influential because they provide a physical basis for abstract cognitive processes, appealing to people's affinity for reductionistic explanations of cognitive phenomena.},

	abstract = {A procedure based on the repertory grid method was used to elicit information from twenty-six female consumers, on the intrinsic product characteristics which they individually perceived in a range of thirty-one chocolate confectionery products. Each subject described a private list of attributes, with corresponding line scales, which she ultimately used to rate all the products. Photographs of the confectionery products were used in the elicitation procedure. The resulting product by attribute matrices, which were qualitatively and quantitatively different for each subject, were input to generalised Procrustes analysis, to yield a product space in four dimensions. Individuals' attributes were organised into thirty-seven classes and these were used to interpret the product space. It was the consensus view of this group of consumers, that attributes associated with sharing and the ability to section the product, together with differences in texture, were the main discrimination features separating the products. Other less important factors were also identified.

Using a preference mapping technique, preference ratings were successfully superimposed on the four dimensional product space. This implies that the main discriminating features were important in determining preference. On the first two dimensions, a majority of this exclusively female panel showed a preference for light/airy textured chocolate, and avoided the more chunky products. However, on the third and fourth dimensions, the main direction of preference was towards the milk chocolate products. Chocolate consumption data derived from a diary study could not be similarly related to the product space.},

We found significant differences in performance depending on the variance of random errors and on the dimensionality of the true underlying consensus. Therefore, we investigated on the dimensionality of the calculated group averages. We found both methods gave too many dimensions compared to the true consensus. This finding is supported by some theoretical considerations. Finally we propose a combined approach which takes advantage of both methods and which gave better results in the simulations.},

Developmental processes have to be analyzed at the level of individual subjects, using time series data characterizing the patterns of intra-individual variation. It is shown that standard statistical techniques based on the analysis of inter-individual variation appear to be insensitive to the presence of arbitrary large degrees of inter-individual heterogeneity in the population. An important class of nonlinear epigenetic models of neural growth is described which can explain the occurrence of such heterogeneity in brain structures and behavior. Links with models of developmental instability are discussed. A simulation study based on a chaotic growth model illustrates the invalidity of standard analysis of inter-individual variation, whereas time series analysis of intra-individual variation is able to recover the true state of affairs. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Formulas for determining the limits of the effect of using the approximate solution are presented. The method is applied to a set of twenty hypothetical tests, defined by their loadings on four orthogonal primary traits. After factoring the inter-correlations of these variables by Thurstone's centroid method, approximating the diagonals, the original hypothetical matrix is reproduced with a root mean square discrepancy of .014 by assuming as known the primary trait loadings of only the first eight tests. The method is applied to the results of factoring two batteries of 14 tests, having 8 tests in common, to give the factor loadings of the two batteries on the same reference axes. The method provides a means of comparing directly and quantitatively the results of two different factor studies, provided they have tests in common, and of testing the stability of simple structure under changes in the battery.

	abstract = {Although effective project management is critical to the success of information technology ({IT}) projects, little empirical research has investigated skill requirements for {IT} project managers ({PMs}). This study addressed this gap by asking 19 practicing {IT} {PMs} to describe the skills that successful {IT} {PMs} exhibit. A semi-structured interview method known as the repertory grid ({RepGrid}) technique was used to elicit these skills. Nine skill categories emerged: client management, communication, general management, leadership, personal integrity, planning and control, problem solving, systems development and team development. Our study complements existing research by providing a richer understanding of several skills that were narrowly defined (client management, planning and control, and problem solving) and by introducing two new skill categories that had not been previously discussed (personal integrity and team development). Analysis of the individual {RepGrids} revealed four distinct ways in which study participants combined skill categories to form archetypes of effective {IT} {PMs}. We describe these four {IT} {PM} archetypes – General Manager, Problem Solver, Client Representative and Balanced Manager – and discuss how this knowledge can be useful for practitioners, researchers and educators. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research.},

By comparing the grids constructed by different stakeholders, they can highlight interferences and generate follow-up questions to resolve them. They demonstrate their approach in a pilot study for a nonprofit organization. Their study shows the technique can readily identify agreements and mismatches in stakeholders' terminologies and can be performed without preliminary training or specific resources.

This paper aims at exploring some of the possible implications of reframing the relationship between {PCP} and {SC}. I point to two important implications: treating {PCP} as a discourse and adding a new metaphor of the person. Finally, I argue that the invitation to reframe the relationship between {PCP} and {SC} extends both approaches and offers more than each of them alone. On one hand, it extends and enriches {SC} theory and points to benefits of applying the {PCP} “toolkit” to constructionist therapy and research. On the other hand, proposed reframing contributes to {PCP} theory and points to new ways of addressing social construction in therapeutic conversations.},

The more structured repertory grid method has been used as an alternative procedure, and is thought to help assessors in vocabulary development. To compare these two procedures, panels of assessors used them to describe the sensory properties of 25 ciders. Generalized Procrustes analyses of the two data sets provided broadly similar results, but the repertory grid method yielded more descriptors and interpretation of the resulting product space was slightly easier. However, the repertory grid method took slightly longer to carry out, and it was concluded that neither method was clearly superior.},

We disentangle conflicting definitions of moderated mediation and describe approaches for estimating and testing a variety of hypotheses involving conditional indirect effects. We introduce standard errors for hypothesis testing and construction of confidence intervals in large samples but advocate that researchers use bootstrapping whenever possible. We also describe methods for probing significant conditional indirect effects by employing direct extensions of the simple slopes method and Johnson-Neyman technique for probing significant interactions. Finally, we provide an {SPSS} macro to facilitate the implementation of the recommended asymptotic and bootstrapping methods. We illustrate the application of these methods with an example drawn from the Michigan Study of Adolescent Life Transitions, showing that the indirect effect of intrinsic student interest on mathematics performance through teacher perceptions of talent is moderated by student math self-concept.},

A noteworthy feature of this procedure is that each isotropic scaling factor is shown to be the product of a standardisation scalar which adjusts for the differences in range of scoring among assessors, and a performance index. An overall performance index for the whole panel is also discussed. The performance indices can be useful in improving the performance of the panel by pointing out whether further training is required for the whole panel or for some specific assessors. Once the isotropic scaling factors are determined, it is possible to derive a group average configuration using one of several algorithms proposed in the statistical literature which aim at matching a set of configurations by means of rotations. A data set is analysed and a simulation study is undertaken in order to demonstrate the method, and the outcomes are compared to those obtained by means of Gower's algorithm for Generalised Procrustes Analysis.},

In the ‘item by use’ appropriateness study high-fat milk users used no particular use-attribute to separate the milks, whereas the low-fat milk users separated the milks to a greater extent on ‘when I want something low in calories’, ‘when I want something that contains little fat’, and ‘when on a diet’.},

	abstract = {A current popular theme in medicine concerns whether and how patients should be involved in treatment choice. Assuming patient involvement is desirable, how should one go about eliciting preferences? A variety of quantitative and qualitative methods exist that may be used for this purpose, one of which is the repertory grid method. This method involves eliciting constructs (reasons) for preferences through comparing sets of three options. This method allows the structured elicitation of the reasons behind individual preferences, but also, when used with generalised procrustes analysis ({GPA}), allows aggregation of individual data to reveal general preference patterns. In this study the repertory grid method was used to examine patient preferences for angina treatments with the goal of, first, gaining some understanding of general patterns of patient preference, and second, examining the likely utility of the technique in this setting. A sample of 21 patients with mild and stable angina from two general practices in Norfolk, {UK} was interviewed using the repertory grid method to elicit the constructs underlying their preferences amongst seven angina treatments (including ‘no treatment’). Individualised questionnaires were then produced and sent to the patients for self-completion, which required rating the extent to which each construct was relevant for each treatment (scored on visual analogue rating scales). Analysis of the ratings, using {GPA}, showed that the constructs clustered around two dimensions: ‘some treatment’ versus ‘no treatment’, and drug treatment versus surgical treatment. While some treatment was generally preferred to no treatment, individuals varied in preference for drug treatments or surgical treatments. Although the latter were generally perceived as ‘effective’ they were also perceived, for example, as ‘invasive’, ‘frightening’, related to ‘negative experiences’, and being more appropriate for when symptoms are severe (‘proportionate’). We consider the implications of these results for involving patients in choosing amongst treatments.},

Generalized Procrustes Analysis showed that meat products were perceived in similar ways across the three age groups, with the middle-aged group sharing perceptions with the older group in particular. Subtle differences between age groups were observed: middle-aged and young consumers perceived white meats and fish as “healthy” and not red meats, which was in contrast to the older group who did describe red meats as “healthy”. Middle-aged and older consumers shared perceptions of lamb and pork chops, roasted chicken and comminuted or processed products; perceiving these more positively than the young group. Communication strategies aimed at influencing meat intakes of middle-aged consumers should be similar to those directed towards other age groups, however it may also be important to note these observed subtle age-related differences in perceptions.},

	abstract = {Zusammenfassung. Ziel dieses
Beitrags ist es, auf Probleme der Aggregation/Disaggregation von Prozessen
hinzuweisen und Lösungsmöglichkeiten vorzuschlagen. Ein Bezug
zur Idiographie/Nomothetik-Kontroverse wird hergestellt. Es werden vier
Fundamentalsätze zur Aggregation von Prozessen formuliert. Theorem
1 behandelt univariate Verläufe: Es weist auf die Schwierigkeiten
hin, von Aggregatverläufen auf individuelle Verläufe zu
schließen. Theorem 2 warnt bei bivariaten Prozessen vor einem
möglichen Fehlschluß von statischen (querschnittlichen,
interindividuellen) auf prozessuale (intraindividuelle) synchrone
Zusammenhänge. Intra- und interindividuelle Beziehungen sind
konzeptuell und empirisch verschieden. Eine Formel beschreibt den
analytischen Zusammenhang zwischen den Korrelationsformen. Theorem 3
zeigt, daß auch bei Längsschnittuntersuchungen i.a. kein
Schluß von Cross-lagged-panel Korrelationen in der Stichprobe
auf asynchrone Beziehungen beim Individuum möglich ist. Theorem
4 behandelt die Reihenfolge von Aggregation und Prognose und
soll die Argumentation zur Priorität eines mikroanalytischen
(intraindividuellen) Vorgehens unterstützen. Abschließend wird
als Lösung der Probleme eine kombiniert idiographisch-nomothetische
Forschungsstrategie empfohlen.},

I call this `virtual witnessing', and its importance was as a means of enlarging the witnessing public. The notion of a `public' for experimental science is, I argue, essential to our understanding of how facts are generated and validated. In these episodes, circumstantial reporting was a technique for creating a public and for constituting authentic knowledge.},

This paper describes two {BASIC} computer programs to elicit and analyse grids easily and clearly. {FOCUS} uses a two-way cluster analytic method to re-order the constructs and the elements to highlight similarities and differences in the grid, and displays the focused results together with tree diagrams of the similarities in elements and constructs. {PEGASUS} is an interactive program which conversationally elicits a grid, processes and offers real-time feedback commentary on the results.},

In contrast, the use of tables and inferential statistics in psychology is inversely related to subfield hardness, suggesting that the relationship between hardness and graph use is not attributable to differences in the use of quantitative data in subfields or their commitment to empiricism.

This measure is considered to be both conceptually and empirically an advance over previous measures. It emphasizes that the structure of a subject's construct system is important, rather than merely its degree of differentiation. In this respect, it has advantages over previous measures based on the repertory grid. Three experiments are described which test the validity and reliability of the new measure. These experiments show that the hierarchical measure is reliable and is unrelated to a measure of differentiation based on the repertory grid. The hierarchical measure is shown to be positively related to performance on Harvey's ‘This I Believe’ test, which has been used as a projective measure of cognitive complexity. The hierarchical measure is also shown to be unrelated to performance on a verbal reasoning task.},

Their findings indicate that the three estimation techniques perform about equally well. {UAM} also is compared with traditional compositional mapping. They find that {UAM} is superior on fit of the solution, interpretability, and sample reliability. {UAM} probably holds an edge with respect to data collection. Traditional compositional mapping is superior on ease of data analysis. No major difference was found on predictive validity and structural reliability.},

Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of {AU} p-value, which has superiority in bias over {BP} value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling.

A theory and method suitable to the study of cognition-defined as personal constructs that individuals use to understand {IT} in organizations-is Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory and its cognitive mapping tool known as the repertory grid ({RepGrid}).

The flexibility of the {RepGrid} is illustrated by examining published studies in {IS}.

A series of studies of 2-dimensional stimuli with separable attributes (including house plants, parallelograms, schematic faces, and histograms), using judgments of similarity and dissimilarity, classification, inference, and recognition errors, all support the coincidence hypothesis. The size of the effect is determined by the separability of the stimuli, the transparency of the dimensional structure, and the discriminability of the levels within each dimension. Applications of the coincidence effect to inductive inference are investigated, and its relations to selective attention and spatial density are discussed. It is concluded that the triangle inequality and segmental additivity cannot be jointly satisfied for separable attributes. The implications of this result for multidimensional scaling are discussed.

Each client who presents with one of the disorders discussed, the author argues, has grown up in contexts, in most cases families, where certain specific values and meanings predominate. In each family where a member has a different kind of disorder, conversation will revolve around a different set of values. A central tenant of the model is that meaning and its organizations are open systems, and thus susceptible to modification. Based on this theory, the author shows therapists how use semantics with their clients to help overcome symptoms"--},

J Mark 1968;32(July):13–20], they propose that different methods measure different dimensions of attribute importance and, more specifically, what methods measure which specific dimensions. A re-examination of existing research reveals convergent and nomological validity among methods that are proposed to measure the same dimensions of attribute importance and discriminant validity between methods that are proposed to measure different dimensions of attribute importance. Acknowledging the multi-dimensionality of attribute importance substantially reduces the apparent lack of validity reported in the literature and forms an important first step enabling practitioners and scholars to improve the validity of attribute-importance measurement.},

	abstract = {Qualitative assessments of behaviour integrate and summarize the different aspects of an animal's dynamic style of interaction with the environment, using descriptors such as `timid' or `confident'. Although such qualitative terms are widely used in the study of animal temperament and personality, their use in relation to questions of animal welfare has yet to be formally explored. The terms used in integrative assessment (e.g., content, distressed) tend to have expressive, welfare-related connotations, and lie at the heart of the lay public's concern for animal suffering. For this reason they are frequently dismissed as `anthropomorphic' and unscientific. However, in theory it is possible that these terminologies reflect observable aspects of behavioural organization. They may therefore be liable to scientific analysis, and be of use as integrative welfare measurements. A first step in investigating this hypothesis is to examine the inter-observer reliability of assessments of behavioural expression. This study investigated the extent to which 18 naive observers showed agreement when given the opportunity to qualitatively describe, independently and in their own words, the behavioural expressions of 20 individual growing pigs. Pigs were brought singly into a test pen and given the opportunity to interact with a human squatting in the centre of the test pen. Observers were instructed to first observe each pig and then to write down terms which adequately summed up the emergent qualities of that pig's behaviour. Data thus consisted of 18 sets of individually generated descriptive terms, attributed to 20 pigs. This procedure was repeated a month later with the same observers but using a new group of 20 pigs. To analyze the resulting 36 sets of descriptive terms, pigs in each set were given a score for each term. This score was either 0 (term not used for that pig) or 1 (term used for that pig). These data were analyzed with Generalized Procrustes Analysis ({GPA}), a multivariate statistical technique which finds a consensus between observer assessment patterns (the `pig consensus profile'), and provides a measure of observer agreement. Results show that for each group of 20 pigs, the `pig consensus profile' differed significantly from an analysis of the same data in randomized form (p\&lt;0.001), indicating that the consensus profiles were not artifacts of the {GPA} procedures. It can therefore be concluded that observers showed significant agreement in their spontaneous assessment of pig expressions, which suggests that these assessments were based on commonly perceived and systematically applied criteria.

The same coffees were also examined by a different panel of assessors not familiar with coffees, using free-choice profiling and, on a separate occasion, similarity scaling procedures. The data from the three experiments were independently subjected to the appropriate statistical techniques to produce two-dimensional diagrams showing the interrelationships of the samples. All three procedures produced similar information both in respect to the way the coffees grouped and differed from one another. The paper concludes by discussing the assessor variation associated with each of the procedures and shows that free choice profiling compares very favourably with the other two.},

In the second study, nutrition and secondary students’ constructs of eight fruits and vegetables were elicited by means of a pairwise comparison technique. The students then rated these foods along their own constructs. The foods and constructs were related to each other by means of principal components analyses. The results indicated that the secondary students construed the foods in more evaluative and sensory terms than the, nutrition students, who were more concerned with processing and physical appearance. The significance of the results is discussed in relation to the style of thinking associated with adolescence and young adulthood, and to the professional roles of nutrition students.

The growing body of research in this area has clearly documented the differences in perceptions between appraisers and appraisees. However, many of these findings are predominately based on aspects of the system in judging its overall effectiveness and rely heavily on self-report questionnaire responses with weak methodological rigor. Not much is known about the deeper cognitive perceptions of appraisers and appraisees in better explaining their attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. This paper breaks away from conventional questionnaire-generated perceptions and applies a unique clinical cognitive mapping methodology called the repertory grid technique to elicit the personal constructs of how real respondents perceive appraisal systems based on their real-life experiences. The method allowed the investigation to go much deeper than past research into the core perceptions that influenced respondents' attitudes and subsequent behaviors. Though the findings showed some commonality in personal constructions of appraisal systems with those found in the literature, new constructs, core perceptual dimensions, and collective cognitive maps were elicited for the very first time, opening up new questions and issues for further research. Implications to theory and practice are also discussed. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Normally, it is empirically estimated based on the scree plot of the total explained variance and interpretability of dimensions, and no statistical method is available so far. In this paper, a new randomisation test was developed to detect significant dimensions of group average space obtained by {GPA}. It was developed from {ANOVA} and the consensus test which was originally proposed by Wakeling et al. especially for validation of {GPA} results. The method was applied to one conventional, two free choice profile sensory data sets and three simulated data sets. The results showed that the proposed randomisation F-test is more effective than the scree plot method. Compared with the Wakeling consensus test of {GPA}, it not only validates the consensus of data, but also identifies the significant dimensions of group average space. It successfully found significant factors for the three sensory data sets, and also correctly detected that there was no consensus in the first two simulated data sets, and there were two significant factors in the third simulated data set.},

Die entscheidende Eigenschaft der Methode besteht darin, dass sie eine durchgängige Transparenz von der Erhebung der Daten bis zur modellhaften Darstellung verallgemeinerter Befunde gewährleisten kann. Damit werden zwei Anforderungen erfüllt: Der Wirklichkeitsbezug gründet in den Erzählungen der Akteure über ihre jeweilige Lebenswelt, die Verallgemeinerungsfähigkeit begründet sich in der regelgeleiteten Datenaufbereitung und -interpretation im Rahmen legitimierter Paradigmen ({KUHN}). Auf diese Weise soll eine größere Nähe zwischen theoretischer, grundlagenorientierter Forschung und konkreter Anwendung, etwa in Planung oder Beratung, gewährleistet werden. Nach einem knappen einführenden Blick auf das interdisziplinäre und psychologische Mobilitätsverständnis werden die Anforderungen an das konkrete Forschungsprojekt "psychologische Grundlagen des Mobilitätshandelns" abgeleitet. Im Kern des Beitrags werden dann Gütekriterien an das einzusetzende Verfahren formuliert und in einer konkreten Beschreibung des methodischen Vorgehens untersucht.
